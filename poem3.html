    <h1>Poem-3</h1>

    
    <h2><b>I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud</b></h2>
    <p>I wandered lonely as a cloud<br/>
      That floats on high o'er vales and hills,<br/>
      When all at once I saw a crowd,<br/>
      A host, of golden daffodils;<br/>
      Beside the lake, beneath the trees,<br/>
      Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.<br/>
      
      Continuous as the stars that shine<br/>
      And twinkle on the milky way,<br/>
      They stretched in never-ending line<br/>
      Along the margin of a bay:<br/>
      Ten thousand saw I at a glance,<br/>
      Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.<br/>
      
      The waves beside them danced; but they<br/>
      Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:<br/>
      A poet could not but be gay,<br/>
      In such a jocund company:<br/>
      I gazed—and gazed—but little thought<br/>
      What wealth the show to me had brought:<br/>
      
      For oft, when on my couch I lie<br/>
      In vacant or in pensive mood,<br/>
      They flash upon that inward eye<br/>
      Which is the bliss of solitude;<br/>
      And then my heart with pleasure fills,<br/>
      And dances with the daffodils.</p>
